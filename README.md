# Data Visualizations with p5.js

This repository showcases a collection of data visualizations created using the p5.js library. In a college class focused on data visualization, we utilized real-world datasets to craft dynamic charts that vividly represent the underlying information.

## Highlights

- **Dynamic Charts**: Each visualization utilizes p5.js to dynamically render charts, making the data come to life.
- **Real Data**: We worked with actual datasets, giving these visualizations real-world relevance.
